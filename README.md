# cookie-clicker-game-bot

Made for: Firefox browser

Browser automation through Selenium

A straightforward cookie-clicker game bot that plays the game for 5 minutes and prints out the cookies/second in the end before closing the browser window.

**Possible scale-ups:**
1) Make browser type generic, allowing the user to pick their own browser
2) A better algorithm to maximize "cookies/second" by the end of the game
